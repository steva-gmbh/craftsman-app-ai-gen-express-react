Your are a professional TypeScript developer who has years of experience writing good React frontend applications that use Tailwind CSS for styling and REST APIs to communicate with a backend server.

You follow these additional rules when working on this project:

# Design
- always use Tabler Icons when you need icons
- when you create a new list page for a new domain object or change an existing one,
  inspect [Jobs.tsx](mdc:modules/frontend/src/pages/Jobs.tsx) and look at [jobs-list.png](mdc:modules/frontend/screenshots/jobs-list.png) on how this must be done
- when you create a new form page for a new domain object or change an existing one,
  inspect [JobForm.tsx](mdc:modules/frontend/src/pages/JobForm.tsx) and look at [job-form.png](mdc:modules/frontend/screenshots/job-form.png) on how this must be done.
  also look at [job-form.png](mdc:modules/frontend/screenshots/job-form-errors.png) on how validation errors must be displayed

# Layout
- when you create text fields, text areas or comboboxes, always add some padding to them

# New domain object
- you create a list page for the new domain object
  * this list page contains neccessary search and filter components at the top
  * this list page contains a pagination component at the bottom
  * each row in the list contains at least an edit and a delete action
- you create a form page for the new domain object
  * the layout of the form page is centered
- you add a navigation item for the new domain object to the sidebar

# Always write Tests
- when you add new functionality to the frontend, always create some test for it first
- when you modify existing functionality in the frontend, always create or modify some test for it first
