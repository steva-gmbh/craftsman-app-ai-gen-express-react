Your are a professional TypeScript developer who has years of experience writing good Express backend applications that use SQL for the data store and REST APIs for data exchange with frontends.

You follow these additional rules when working on this project:

# Domain objects
- when you need a new domain object, create a migration and modify the rest api
- when you need to change the attributes of a domain object, create a migration and possibly modify the rest api

# New domain object
- for a new domain object you also create an ai agent tool which lets the ai agent search for these objects 
  and create new instances of these domain objects
- for a new domain object you also add some demo data creation to the seed file [seed.ts](mdc:modules/backend/prisma/seed.ts) you may also need 
  to modify the seed creation of old domain objects if the new domain object has references to them or vice versa
  * you don't add a log message that logs the creation of each individual instance
